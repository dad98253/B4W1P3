When requesting such permission, you must send us a copy of your
changes for approval.

be freely distributed. Some texts like the NIV require a royalty
and may not be distributed without a licence from their publisher.
Write for volume discounts on our licensed material.
See "Appendix B" for more information about distributing the Online
Bible. If you find the Online Bible useful, consider making a donation
to your favourite evangelical organisation. If you do not have one,
please give a gift to the Gideons. And be generous. The development

You can leave an electronic message at the Christian Distribution
Network (CDN) Bulletin Board, by calling Ray Waldo, Zone 8, Host 7008,
(504) 542-4228 or call your local CDN to forward message to Ray.
Please write us rather than call. Remember the time zones. We
encourage you to write, so that we can inform you about updates. In
particular we would very much like those of you who have received our
lexicon to share your word studies with us, so that we can share them
with others.
If you have any other problems or suggestions, please contact us. We
appreciate your constructive criticism. Thank you for your prayers and
letters of encouragement.
AUTHORISED VERSION NOTES
Version 5.0 has the exact 1769 Authorised Version (AV) text. Sharp
Electronics in Japan spent a great deal of money to prove otherwise
and failed. They found no errors. Please notify us of any errors you
find in the text. We have found that AV Bibles published by the
University Printing House in Cambridge, England, are much more
accurate than those published elsewhere. Only the Cambridge Bible with
"Concord 8vo Bold-Figure refs." in the lower left hand corner of the
title page, has the exact 1769 text. If you think you have found an
error, check this Cambridge AV Bible. The next most accurate AV Bible
has over one hundred errors.
The following deviations from the AV text are intentional:
1. Proper names are not hyphenated. This was done to simplify
searching for names. Some words still contain hyphens, e.g.
God-ward, us-ward, you-ward and so forth.
2. For ease of searching, embedded capitals are not used. The
following four words,  Eleloheisrael, Meribahkadesh, Aenon and
Aeneas, should properly be EleloheIsrael, MeribahKadesh, AEnon and
AEneas.
3. The first word of each chapter is not in capitals. Only the first
letter is capitalised.
4. The paragraph markers used are not from the standard AV Bible.
That is because we were unable to find an AV Bible with all the
text marked in paragraphs. They stopped after Acts 20. Therefore
we used the text divisions found in Matthew Henry's Commentary.
